Subject: Farewell and Heartfelt Thanks

Dear Gift City Team,

As I prepare to say goodbye, I find myself filled with gratitude and a bit of nostalgia. Today marks my last day here, and while I'm excited about what the future holds, it's incredibly hard to leave behind such a fantastic group of people.

My time here at Gift City has been nothing short of extraordinary. The bond we have shared is something I will always treasure. There was never a dull moment, whether we were tackling challenging projects or simply enjoying each other’s company. Our lunches, dinners, and team outings are memories I will hold dear. You all made work feel less like a job and more like spending time with friends.

Working with each of you has been a privilege. Your support, laughter, and camaraderie have made my journey here truly special. We’ve celebrated successes, faced challenges, and grown together in ways I will always be proud of. You have not just been colleagues but friends who have made a significant impact on my life.

I will deeply miss our time together—the jokes, the shared meals, and the amazing experiences. It’s rare to find such a cohesive and supportive team, and I feel incredibly fortunate to have been a part of it.

Though I’m moving on to new adventures, I would love to stay in touch with all of you. Please feel free to reach out to me anytime at [your personal email]. Let’s continue to share our journeys and keep our wonderful connections alive.

Thank you all for everything. It has been an absolute joy to work alongside such remarkable individuals. I wish you all continued success, happiness, and many more wonderful moments together.

Warmest regards,

[Your Name]

Sure, here's a basic example of C# code to connect to an Oracle database and execute a script on the server:using System;
using Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.Client;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string connectionString = "Data Source=<your_data_source>;User Id=<your_username>;Password=<your_password>;";

        try
        {
            using (OracleConnection connection = new OracleConnection(connectionString))
            {
                connection.Open();

                // Write your SQL script here
                string sqlScript = "SELECT * FROM your_table";

                using (OracleCommand command = new OracleCommand(sqlScript, connection))
                {
                    using (OracleDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader())
                    {
                        while (reader.Read())
                        {
                            // Process the result if needed
                            Console.WriteLine(reader.GetString(0));
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("An error occurred: " + ex.Message);
        }
    }
}
Make sure to replace <your_data_source>, <your_username>, and <your_password> with your actual database connection details. Also, replace "SELECT * FROM your_table" with your actual SQL script.Note: This code assumes you have installed the Oracle Managed Data Access (ODP.NET) NuGet package. You can install it via NuGet Package Manager or using the following command in the Package Manager Console:Install-Package Oracle.ManagedDataAccess
